      <description>My goal is to translate the C++ code in GEMMA/src/mvlmm.cpp to mathematical notation and, ultimately, to R code. Zhou’s C++ code uses the gsl C++ library.
CalcXHiY C++ code Let’s examine the function CalcXHiY which runs from line 357-384 of mvlmm.cpp. I reproduce them here:
void CalcXHiY(const gsl_vector *eval, const gsl_vector *D_l, const gsl_matrix *X, const gsl_matrix *UltVehiY, gsl_vector *xHiy) { size_t n_size=eval-&amp;gt;size, c_size=X-&amp;gt;size1, d_size=D_l-&amp;gt;size; gsl_vector_set_zero (xHiy); double x, delta, dl, y, d; for (size_t i=0; i&amp;lt;d_size; i++) { dl=gsl_vector_get(D_l, i); for (size_t j=0; j&amp;lt;c_size; j++) { d=0.</description>

      <title>A ‘page’ type for blogdown &amp; hugo lithium theme</title>

      <description>I didn’t like the fact that my ‘About’ and ‘Research’ pages included a Disqus section, as I don’t need comments on these materials. I decided to find a way to create pages - which are not blog posts - that don’t have the Disqus section. I’m using, as of right now, Yihui Xie’s hugo lithium theme, with a few small modifications that I’ve documented in my first blog post.
The Hugo documentation on types is quite good.</description>

      <description>I need to estimate variance components for a linear mixed effects model. Specifically, I need to consider the model, from Zhou and Stephens (2014):
\[Y = BX + G + E\] where \(Y\) is a \(2\) by \(n\) matrix of (possibly correlated) phenotypes (for \(n\) subjects), \(B\) is a \(2\) by \(c\) matrix of allelic effect sizes (where \(c\) denotes the number of alleles per locus), \(X\) is a \(c\) by \(n\) matrix containing genotypes (or genotype probabilities), \(G\) is a \(2\) by \(n\) matrix of random effects and \(E\) is a \(2\) by \(n\) matrix of random errors, which are assumed to be independent of \(G\).</description>

      <description>While browsing the internet, I stumbled upon Rstudio’s new package blogdown. I read posts from Karl Broman and found the the book that the package authors - Yihui Xie and Amber Thomas - freely share.
One tricky part of setting up the website involved the DNS settings. I bought the site fboehm.us through google domains. While the blogdown book provides instructions for DNS settings for other domain name providers, at the time I set up my site, they hadn’t written instructions for use with google domains.</description>
