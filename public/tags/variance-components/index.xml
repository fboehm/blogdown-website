      <description>My goal is to translate the C++ code in GEMMA/src/mvlmm.cpp to mathematical notation and, ultimately, to R code.</description>

      <description>I need to estimate variance components for a linear mixed effects model. Specifically, I need to consider the model, from Zhou and Stephens (2014):
\[Y = BX + G + E\] where \(Y\) is a \(2\) by \(n\) matrix of (possibly correlated) phenotypes (for \(n\) subjects), \(B\) is a \(2\) by \(c\) matrix of allelic effect sizes (where \(c\) denotes the number of alleles per locus), \(X\) is a \(c\) by \(n\) matrix containing genotypes (or genotype probabilities), \(G\) is a \(2\) by \(n\) matrix of random effects and \(E\) is a \(2\) by \(n\) matrix of random errors, which are assumed to be independent of \(G\).</description>
